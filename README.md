Credit Score Modelling

Predicting an individual’s credit risk is a key task in the financial industry. This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to be high-risk or low-risk based on historical data.

Project Overview
Credit Score Modelling helps financial institutions decide whether to grant credit by analyzing various applicant attributes. This repository demonstrates how to:
Load and preprocess the dataset
Train a Random Forest Classifier
Evaluate the model’s performance

Dataset
Name: Creditworthiness.csv (or any other CSV you use)
Description: Contains applicant features (e.g., income, age, etc.) and a target column Risk that indicates high or low risk.
Important: If you do not have the original dataset, you can use an alternative (e.g., the German Credit dataset or any similar dataset). In your code, make sure to replace the CSV URL or file path accordingly.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

Install them with:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Usage
1. Clone the repository (or download the ZIP):
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Credit-Score-Modelling.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd Credit-Score-Modelling
3. Install required packages:
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
(Alternatively, install them manually as shown in Requirements.)
4. Run the Python script:
5. python credit_score_model.py
6. View the output:

The script will print the Accuracy and a Classification Report in the console.
Model Explanation
RandomForestClassifier:
An ensemble method that trains multiple decision trees on different subsets of the dataset.
The final prediction is made by taking the majority vote of all the individual trees.

Why Random Forest?
It generally provides high accuracy and handles missing data and outliers well.
Less likely to overfit compared to a single decision tree.

Results
Accuracy Score: A quick measure of how many predictions are correct.
Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class (e.g., High Risk vs. Low Risk).

Interpretation:
High Precision means few false positives.
High Recall means few false negatives.
F1-score balances precision and recall
